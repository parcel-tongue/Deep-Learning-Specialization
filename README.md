# Deep-Learning-Specialization on Coursera by Andrew Ng
Deep Learning Specialization. Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI

In five courses, the foundations of Deep Learning, understanding how to build neural networks, how to lead successful machine learning projects, Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more will be explained.

case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing will be worked on. the theory will not only be mastered but also its application in the industry. All these ideas will be practiced in Python and in TensorFlow.

The Specialization includes:

Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

Structuring Machine Learning Projects

Convolutional Neural Networks

Sequence Models
